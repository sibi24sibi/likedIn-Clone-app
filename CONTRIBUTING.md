## Prefix Conventions for Commit Message and Branch Naming

Here are the recommended prefixes for commit messages and branch names, along with explanations:

- **feat:** For new feature implementations.

- **bug:** For bug fixes.

- **refactor:** For code refactoring without altering functionality.

- **docs:** For documentation-related changes.

- **chore:** For general maintenance or unrelated tasks.

- **style:** For commits related to code style/formatting changes.

## Branch Naming Conventions

We follow a structured approach to branch names. Please use the following format when creating branches:

- **Feature Branches:** `feat/{issue-number}-{short-description}`
  - Example: `feat/123-add-user-authentication`
  
- **Bug Branches:** `bug/{issue-number}-{short-description}`
  - Example: `bug/456-fix-login-issue`

## Commit Message Guidelines

Use meaningful prefixes in your commit messages to categorize the type of changes.

- **feat:** For new feature implementations.
  - Example: `feat: Add user authentication functionality`

- **bug:** For bug fixes.
  - Example: `bug: Resolve issue with login button not working`

## Note

Please ensure your commits are descriptive, concise, and follow the specified format. This helps in maintaining a clean and understandable commit history.
